=========================

Annoyed of writing some generic parts or even the ingredients of the next recipes you want to cook
on your shopping list?

This little tool may help. You can easily prepare some recipes or generic parts you want to buy from
time to time in an URL, an NFC Tag (with your phone) or a QR Code.

For an Import all you have todo is to open the URL by Clicking or scanning. The Shoppinglist App
Bring! will open and that's it.
